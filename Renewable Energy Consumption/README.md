# Renewable Energy Consumption

## Description

This project takes renewable energy consumption data and performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression of certain renewable energy sources.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes renewable energy conumption from 1973 to 2023. 

## Methodology
**EDA**: Found the shape and data types of the dataset.  Found the number of missing values and the percent of missing values.  Found the descriptive statistics of the numerical columns. Imputated the data using multiple imputation.  <br />
**Visualization**: Produced interaction graphs of every combination of variables and a heatmap of their correlation.

## Results

- The renewable energy sources biomass and wood energy had the highest mean of consumption.
- Solar Energy and Wind Energy consumption have a correlation with a r-squared value of 0.514. Using a polynomial regression model, the Mean Squared Error was able to be reduced to 55.887.


## Usage
