# Country Emissions Analysis

## Description

This purpose of this code is to compare the amount of carbon emissions between countries around the world.

## Skills Demonstrate
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes carbon emissions from countries around the globe given in millon tonnes of carbon.

## Methodology
**Data Cleaning**: Drop data before 1994 since there aren't many data points before then.
**EDA**: Determining the top 10 countries with the most amount of carbon emissions since 1994.  Determining how much of these emissions are contributed per capita.
**Visualization**: Creating bar graphs to show the top 10 countries in order by amount of carbon emissions since 1994 and amount of these emissions per capita. 

## Results

- Identified the top countries with carbon emissions since 1994 measured by million tonnes of carbon.
- Identified the top countries with these carbon emissions per capita.

## Usage 

To run this analysis, open the 'country_emissions_analysis.ipynb' notebook and execute the cells.
